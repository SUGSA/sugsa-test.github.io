            <p>SUGSA’s mission is to nurture curiosity within the Agile space. We aim to create opportunities
                for learning, sharing, and connecting, in support of a healthy, vibrant community of users of
                Agile and lightweight software development methods and processes. SUGSA is a non-profit
                group, run by a committee of volunteers.</p>

            <p>This document details the SUGSA committee’s expectations of speakers at the conference
                (speakers and workshop facilitators will be referred to as ‘speakers’ throughout this document).
                Please get in touch with us on <a href="emailto:info@sugsa.org.za">info@sugsa.org.za</a> should you have

                relating to this document.</p>

            <h3>General code of conduct:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>SUGSA is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for
                    everyone, regardless of gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance,
                    body size, race, or religion (or lack thereof). All speakers are expected to adhere to
                    SUGSA’s Code of Conduct:
                    <a href="https://sugsa.org.za/about-us/code-of-conduct/"
                       target="_blank">https://sugsa.org.za/about-us/code-of-conduct/</a>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Accommodation and Travel</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>SUGSA will arrange and pay for accommodation for the speaker (workshop, talks, and
                    lightning talks) for the 2 nights of the conference. This accommodation and travel
                    allowance is not exchangeable for other dates or persons, nor is it exchangeable for
                    cash.
                </li>
                <li>For local speakers (within SA), excluding lightning talks - SUGSA will reimburse travel
                    costs (flights, taxis etc.) up to the value of R3000. Receipts will be required for all
                    reimbursement costs.
                </li>
                <li>For international speakers (outside SA), excluding lightning talks - SUGSA will reimburse
                    travel costs (flights, taxis etc.) up to the value of R22 000. Receipts will be required for all
                    reimbursement costs.
                </li>
                <li>For lightning talk speakers - SUGSA will reimburse travel costs (flights, taxis etc.) up to
                    the value of R1000. Receipts will be required for all reimbursement costs.
                </li>
                <li>Speakers who do not reside in the same city as the conference are requested to arrive
                    the night before the conference so that they are able to attend both days. Should this not
                    be possible, please make alternative arrangements with a SUGSA committee member.
                </li>
                <li>Reimbursement process:
                    <ul>
                        <li>In order for reimbursements to be paid, a travel invoice will need to be submitted
                            to SUGSA for processing. The original invoice from the travel provider is a
                            regulatory requirement necessary for us to release foreign payments.
                        </li>
                        <li>Reimbursements will only be processed after the completion of the conference.</li>
                        <li>Speakers should have submitted reimbursement claims no later than 14 days
                            after the conference.
                        </li>
                        <li>Any claims received after the cut-off date may experience delays in processing.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Community Involvement</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Our speakers are an important part of our community. As such, we expect speakers to
                    attend and participate, as much as possible, during the conference.
                </li>
                <li>While we do not expect speakers to attend every session, we request speakers to be at
                    the opening and closing Keynotes, as well as being available to the community for the
                    duration of the 2-day conference (whether that be by attending sessions or finding
                    alternative mechanisms to connect with the community during the conference).
                </li>
                <li>The Speakers’ Dinner is held the night before the conference begins, with speakers,
                    committee members, and sponsors, at SUGSA’s cost. It is requested that speakers
                    make themselves available for this, or agree to alternative arrangements with a
                    committee member.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>During Workshops or Talks</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>By agreeing to speak at the Regional Scrum Gathering® South Africa, speakers consent
                    to have a committee member introduce them to the audience and to ensure that the
                    session remains on schedule. This includes the use of visual cues (printed flashcards) to
                    indicate progress against the scheduled end time, and bringing the session to a close if
                    the speaker does not do so timeously. For either format, we recommend allocating the
                    last 15 minutes for questions and answers from the audience. We pride ourselves on
                    hosting a conference where all speakers respect each other and the audience, allowing
                    us to run on schedule.
                </li>
                <li>SUGSA will provide the following stationery and supplies:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Stickies (Post-it notes)</li>
                        <li>Markers</li>
                        <li>AV facilities</li>
                        <li>Flipcharts, 1 per room</li>
                        <li>Tech connections</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>It is expected that the talk or workshop a speaker gives remains aligned to the content
                    and structure as submitted in their proposal, and accepted onto the program. We request
                    that as a speaker you pay careful attention to this as conference attendees make
                    selections for talks they would like to attend based on the information submitted and
                    published.
                </li>
                <li>If a speaker would like us to share their slides with our community following the
                    conference, we require the slides within two working days from the last day of the
                    conference.
                </li>
                <li>SUGSA will collect feedback after the talk or workshop via the event app. The feedback
                    will be shared with the speaker following the conference.
